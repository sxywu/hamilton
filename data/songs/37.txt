The Reynolds Pamphlet
Have you read this?
Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair
And he wrote it down right there
Highlights!
“The charge against me is a connection with one James Reynolds!
For purposes of improper speculation
My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife
For a considerable time with his knowing consent"
Damn!
“I had frequent meetings with her most of them at my own house.”
At his own house!
At his own house!
Damn!
“Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent on a visit to her father.”
No…
Boooo!

Well, he’s never gon’ be President now
Never gon’ be President now
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now
Never gon’ be President now
He’s never gon’ be President now
Never gon’ be President now
That’s one less thing to worry about
That’s one less thing to worry about!
I came as soon as I heard
What?!
Angelica—
All the way from London?!
Damn
Angelica, thank God
Someone who understands what I’m struggling here to do
I’m not here for you
Oooooh!
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside
I’m standing at her side
You could never be satisfied
God, I hope you’re satisfied
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now
Never gon’ be President now
Well, he’s never gon’ be President now
That’s one less thing to worry about.
Hey!
At least he was honest with our money!
Hey!
At least he was honest with our money!
That’s one less thing to worry about!

His poor wife
