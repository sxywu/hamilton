I may not live to see our glory!
I may not live to see our glory!
But I will gladly join the fight!
But I will gladly join the fight!
And when our children tell our story…
And when our children tell our story…
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Let’s have another round tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there’ll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Let’s have another round tonight
Raise a glass to the four of us
Tomorrow there’ll be more of us
Telling the story of tonight
Let’s have another round tonight
They’ll tell the story of tonight
They’ll tell the story of tonight
They’ll tell the story of tonight
Tonight
