Alexander, come back to sleep
I have an early meeting out of town
It’s still dark outside
I know. I just need to write something down
Why do you write like you’re running out of time?
Shhh
Come back to bed. That would be enough
I’ll be back before you know I’m gone
Come back to sleep
This meeting’s at dawn
Well, I’m going back to sleep
Hey. Best of wives and best of women
