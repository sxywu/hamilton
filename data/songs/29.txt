Look!
Grandpa’s in the paper!
“War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr”
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate
Sometimes that’s how it goes
Daddy’s gonna find out any minute
I’m sure he already knows
Further down
Further down
Let’s meet the newest senator from New York
New York
Our senator
Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?
Since being one put me on the up and up again
No one knows who you are or what you do
They don’t need to know me
They don’t like you
Excuse me?
Oh, Wall Street thinks you’re great
You’ll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate—
Wait
—people think you’re crooked
Schuyler’s seat was up for grabs so I took it
I’ve always considered you a friend
I don’t see why that has to end!
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall...
