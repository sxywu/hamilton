They say
The price of my war’s not a price that they’re willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I’m fighting with France and with Spain
I’m so blue
I thought that we’d made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I’ve got
A small query for you:
What comes next?
You’ve been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?
You’re on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?
Oceans rise
Empires fall
It’s much harder when it’s all your call
All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, don’t
Come crawling back to me
Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...
You’re on your own…
