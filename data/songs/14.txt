Stay alive…
Stay alive…
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.”
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence
The cavalry’s not coming
But, sir!
Alex, listen. There’s only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright
That’s right
Don’t engage, strike by night
Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight
Outrun
Outrun
Outlast
Outlast
Hit ‘em quick, get out fast
Chick-a-plao!
Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past
We’re gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast
Raise a glass!
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day’s a test of our camaraderie and bravery
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev’ry day
“Sir, entrust me with a command,”
And ev’ry day
No
He dismisses me out of hand
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:
I’m a General. Whee!!!!
Yeah. He’s not the choice I would have gone with
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth
Ev’ryone attack!
Retreat!
Attack!
Retreat!
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!
But there’s so many of them!
I’m sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!
Ready, sir!
Have Lafayette take the lead!
Yes, sir!
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin’ this to anybody who would listen:
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution is turn n’
Go back to plantin’ tobacco in Mount Vernon
Ooh!!
Don’t do a thing. History will prove him wrong
But, sir!
We have a war to fight, let’s move along
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it
I can’t disobey direct orders
Then I’ll do it
Alexander, you’re the closest friend I’ve got
Laurens, do not throw away your shot
