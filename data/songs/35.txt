Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?
We have the check stubs. From separate accounts…
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in seventeen ninety-one
Is that what you have? Are you done?
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position—
Though ‘virtue’ is not a word I’d apply to this situation—
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission—
And the evidence suggests you’ve engaged in speculation—
An immigrant embezzling our government funds—
I can almost see the headline, your career is done
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!
Ha! You don’t even know what you’re asking me to confess
Confess
You have nothing. I don’t have to tell you anything at all
Unless
Unless
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?
No one else was in the room where it happened
Is that a yes?
Um, yes
“Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to—”
Whaaaat—
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That’s when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects but my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list n’ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn’t mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that’s fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?
My God
Gentlemen, let’s go
So?
The people won't know what we know
Burr!
How do I know you won’t use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?
Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both know what we know
