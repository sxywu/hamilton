Lee, do you yield?
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!
I’m satisfied
Yo, we gotta clear the field!
Go! We won
Here comes the General!
This should be fun
What is the meaning of this?
Mr. Burr? get a medic for the General
Yes, sir
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don’t speak for me
Thank you for your service
Let’s ride!
Hamilton!
Sir!
Meet me inside
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!
Son—
Don’t call me son
This war is hard enough without infighting—
Lee called you out. We called his bluff
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would’ve shut him up
Son—
I’m notcha son—
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud
My name’s been through a lot, I can take it
Well, I don’t have your name. I don’t have your titles
I don’t have your land
But, if you—
No—
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war
Or you could die and we need you alive
I’m more than willing to die—
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive—
Call me son one more time—
Go home, Alexander
That’s an order from your commander
Sir—
Go home
