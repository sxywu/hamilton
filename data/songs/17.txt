Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…
How long have you known?
A month or so
Eliza, you should have told me
I wrote to the General a month ago
No
I begged him to send you home
You should have told me
I’m not sorry
I knew you’d fight until the war was won
But you deserve a chance to meet
Your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now.
Will you relish being a poor man’s wife
Unable to provide for your life?
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around…
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough
I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind
But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough
We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart…
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough
