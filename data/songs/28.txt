Ah, Mister Secretary
Mister Burr, sir
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?
No
You know Clermont Street?
Yeah
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure
Sure
And all he had to do was die
That’s a lot less work
We oughta give it a try
Ha
Now how’re you gonna get your debt plan through?
I guess I’m gonna fin’ly have to listen to you
Really?
“Talk less. Smile more.”
Ha
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner
Hamilton!
I’m sorry Burr, I’ve gotta go
But—
Decisions are happening over dinner
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room
Diametric’ly opposed, foes
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were
Previously closed, bros
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation’s capital
And here’s the pièce de résistance:
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the game is played
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.
Thomas claims—
Alexander was on Washington’s doorstep one day
In distress ‘n disarray
Thomas claims—
Alexander said—
I’ve nowhere else to turn!
And basic’ly begged me to join the fray
Thomas claims—
I approached Madison and said—
“I know you hate ‘im, but let’s hear what he has to say.”
Thomas claims—
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating
But!
No one else was in—
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in—
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yesssss
The pieces that are sacrificed in
Ev’ry game of chesssss
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.
Meanwhile—
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev’ry issue can be settled by committee
Meanwhile—
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—
It isn’t pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words—
Oh-ho!
A quid pro quo
I suppose
Wouldn’t you like to work a little closer to home?
Actually, I would
Well, I propose the Potomac
And you’ll provide him his votes?
Well, we’ll see how it goes
Let’s go
No!
—one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
My God!
In God we trust
But we’ll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened
And no one else was in the room where it happened
Alexander Hamilton!
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?
Alexander Hamilton!
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?
Alexander Hamilton!
Or did you know, even then, it doesn’t matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?
Cuz we’ll have the banks
We’re in the same spot
You got more than you gave
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don’t get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!
God help and forgive me
I wanna build something that’s gonna
Outlive me
What do you want, Burr?
What do you want, Burr?
If you stand for nothing
Burr, what do you fall for?
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be
In the room where it happens
I
I wanna be in the room…
Oh
Oh
I wanna be
I wanna be
I’ve got to be
I’ve got to be
In that room
In that big ol’ room	COMPANY
I wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I wanna be in the room
Where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
I wanna be in
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens.
The art of the compromise—
Hold your nose and close your eyes
We want our leaders to save the day—
But we don’t get a say in what they trade away
We dream of a brand new start—
But we dream in the dark for the most part
Dark as a tomb where it happens
I’ve got to be in the room…
I’ve got to be...
I’ve got to be...
Oh, I’ve got to be in
The room where it happens…
I’ve got to be, I’ve gotta be, I’ve gotta be…
In the room!
Click-boom!
