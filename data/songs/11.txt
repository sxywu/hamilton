Alright, alright. That’s what I’m talkin’ about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!
A toast to the groom!
To the bride!
From your sister
Who is always by your side
To your union
And the hope that you provide
May you always…
Be satisfied
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
This is not a game…
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where’s your fam’ly from?
Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…
Helpless…
And I know she is…
Helpless…
And her eyes are just…
Helpless…
And I realize
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
Where are you taking me?
I’m about to change your life
Then by all means, lead the way
Number one!
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you
Schuyler?
My sister
Number two!
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it
I’ll leave you to it
Number three!
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”
She’d be lying
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…
To the groom!
To the bride!
From your sister
Who is always by your side
To your union
And the hope that you provide
May you always
Be satisfied
And I know
She’ll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied
