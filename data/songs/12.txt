I may not live to see our glory!
I may not live to see our glory!
But I’ve seen wonders great and small
I’ve seen wonders great and small
‘Cause if the tomcat can get married
If Alexander can get married—
There’s hope for our ass, after all!
Raise a glass to freedom
Hey!
Something you will never see again!
No matter what she tells you
Let’s have another round tonight!
Raise a glass to the four of us!
Ho!
To the newly not poor of us!
Woo!
We’ll tell the story of tonight
Let’s have another round—
Well, if it isn’t Aaron Burr
Sir
I didn’t think that you would make it
To be sure
Burr!
I came to say congratulations
Spit a verse, Burr!
I see the whole gang is here
You are the worst, Burr!
Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George’s journal
No, you don’t
Yes, I do
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you’ve made yourself indispensable
Well, well, I heard
You’ve got a special someone on the side, Burr
Is that so?
What are you tryin’ to hide, Burr?
I should go
No, these guys should go
What?
No!
Leave us alone
Man…
It’s alright, Burr. I wish you’d brought this girl with you tonight, Burr
You’re very kind, but I’m afraid it’s unlawful, sir
What do you mean?
She’s married
I see
She’s married to a British officer
Oh shit…
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I’ll see you on the other side of the war
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?
I’ll see you on the other side of the war
I’ll see you on the other side of the war
