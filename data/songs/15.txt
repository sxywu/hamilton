One, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments
It’s the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action
Number two!
If they don’t, grab a friend, that’s your second
Your lieutenant when there’s reckoning to be reckoned
Number three!
Have your seconds meet face to face
Negotiate a peace…
Or negotiate a time and place
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!
If they don’t reach a peace, that’s alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility
You have him turn around so he can have deniability
Five!
Duel before the sun is in the sky
Pick a place to die where it’s high and dry
Number six!
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in
Seven!
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment
Of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent
Number eight!
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…

Aaron Burr, sir
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr
With his life? We both know that’s absurd, sir
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?
Okay, so we’re doin’ this
Number nine!
Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require.  Then count
One two three four
Five six seven eight nine
Number
Ten paces!
